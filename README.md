# Roboracer Speed Control Program

This repository contains the files for the various speed control programs created for the Roboracer. These speed control programs take in a set of distance and duration values and convert them into a speed protocol for a robot.

The current program is written in Arduino for a mock prototype of the Roboracer, and randomly generates a program. Future implementations will allow Bluetooth communication for programming the robot.

To run, connect the Arduino robot to the machine running the Arduino IDE, and select Sketch > Upload Using Programmer. The library for the SR04 sonar sensor must be installed.
